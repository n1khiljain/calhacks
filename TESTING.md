## üîç Debugging Tips

### Backend Issues
```bash
# Enable debug mode
cd backend
FLASK_ENV=development python app.py

# Check database contents
sqlite3 submissions.db ".schema"
sqlite3 submissions.db "SELECT * FROM submissions;"
```

### Frontend Issues
```bash
# Check browser console (F12)
# Look for network errors
# Verify API calls going to http://localhost:5000

# Check React errors
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Database Issues
```bash
# Reset database
cd backend
rm submissions.db
python app.py  # Will recreate tables
```
